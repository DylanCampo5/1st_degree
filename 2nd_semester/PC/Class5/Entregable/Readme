Create something that calculates the number e up to a precision that we are going to tell it
The program will ask me for the maximum error to comment, I will say "I want to calculate the number e with an error of one 
thousandth (0.001)", it will calculate one term, and then the next, and then the next and so on.
The error will always be less than the last term that I have calculated with the addition of fractions formula 
with the factorial.

e = 1/0! +1/1! +1/2! +1/3! +1/4!
This last one is 1/24, if it is less than 0.001, I stop, if not, I add another
